# Testing the Brain Alignment of Models with High Effective Dimensionality

## Basic Overview
This project investigates the relationship between **effective dimensionality(ED)** and **brain alignment** in the vision models using the framework Brain-Score. Previous studies have highlighted both the benefits of low and high dimensionality in deep neural networks (DNNs). 

Specifically, a recent study found a potential connection between high ED and improved alignment with brain activity. This project aims to test the findings in the recent study by expading the scope of layers and models for investigation. Additionally, we aim to offer new perspectives on model interpretability, brain-inspired AI, and the broader connection between artificial and biological intelligence.

This project is conducted as a project2 of the CS-433 ML course Fall 2024 at EPFL. collaborating with neuroAI lab in EPFL.
